# Image Processing

### Summary
This is a task from our college. We have to make a simple image processing program using Java. The program should be able to perform the following operations:
1. Grayscale
2. Thresholding
3. Image Brightening
4. Arithmetic Operations
5. Boolean Operations
6. Geometry Operations
7. Edge Detection
   - Sobel
   - Canny
   - Gaussian

### Features
1. **Grayscale**: Transform colored image into gray
2. **Thresholding**: Separate the image into two parts, one is the object and the othr is the background
3. **Image Brightening**: Change the brightness of the image
4. **Arithmetic Operations**: using arithmetic operations for each pixels from two image you want to
   - Add 
   - Subtract
   - Multiply
   - Divide
